**Project HealthSync Overview and Usage Guide V1.35**

**Version:** 1.35 (Updated July 10, 2025)  
**Objective:**  
SanteBridge develops HealthSync, a web platform to bridge patient-doctor
collaboration and optimize clinic outcomes by transforming
patient-driven data into actionable insights. Patients log health inputs
(food type/quantity, cholesterol/saturated fat, exercise type/intensity,
weight) for proprietary predictions (e.g., 90-day A1C, 6-week LDL/HDL).
Doctors access concise summaries, trends, and projections highlighting
progress, outcomes, and interventions. Clinics own proprietary data on
their servers for efficiencies, revenue (e.g., de-identified sales), and
scalable tools for conditions like diabetes/dyslipidemia. Built
HIPAA-compliant with AI readiness, HealthSync adapts across conditions
for long-term relevance.

**CoreSetup Usage Guide V1.3**  
**Purpose:**  
Concise overview of CoreSetup for HealthSync's table-based logging.
Establishes UI, log management, and interactions as foundation for
modules like DataEntry. Focuses on interfaces, architecture, and
extensibility without deep implementation details.

**Version History:**

- V1.0 (03/27/2025): Initial outline.

- V1.1 (04/04/2025): Time entry fixes, modal styling.

- V1.2 (04/05/2025): Finalized 26 columns, dynamic rows, modal layout.

- V1.3: Cleaned redundancies, aligned with current architecture (e.g.,
  localStorage persistence).

**Functionality Overview:**

- Log Management: Create/switch/delete/export logs via modals/dropdowns.

- Table Structure: 26 columns (A-Z) with Input (A,D,F,G,I,V,W), List
  (E), Output (B,C,H,J-Z). Dynamic rows up to 3000/year, placeholder at
  end.

- Row Management: Context menu for add/delete actions.

- UI Elements: Nav bar, buttons, displays.

**Key Functionalities:** (Use table for clarity)

| **Functionality** | **Inputs** | **Outputs** |
|----|----|----|
| Log Table Setup | Start/End Date, Rows/Day | 26-column table, editable fields, alternating colors. |
| Multi-Year Management | Year selection, edits | Updated displays, CSV exports (HealthSync_Log_YYYY.csv). |
| Personal Data | Doctor/Patient Names | Stored in logs, displayed. |
| Navigation Bar | Static links | Responsive nav, mobile toggle (☰). |
| Functional Buttons | Clicks, form data | New logs, updates, exports/deletes. |

**Program Structure Notes:**

- Files: health-log.html (main), setup.js (logic), styles.css (styling),
  nav.js (nav).

- Key Functions: initializeLogTable(), saveTableDataToLog(),
  exportLogToCSV().

- Data Storage: localStorage (healthsync.logs array with year, dates,
  names, tableData).

- Extensibility: Modify COLUMN_CONFIG for columns; add nav links easily.

**Starting Point for Future Modules:**

- Table: 26 columns, dynamic rows, editable Inputs/Lists.

- Data: localStorage may be empty or populated; load most recent year.

- UI: Nav bar, controls, table.

**Inputs Expected:** User inputs via modals/dropdowns/context menu;
system from localStorage.

**Notes for Future Modules:**

- Access: Use JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("healthsync.logs")) for
  data.

- Styling: Use .healthsync-\* classes.

- Integration: Add buttons to .log-controls; use onchange for updates.

- Error Handling: Dialogs for invalid inputs/limits.

- Scalability: Prep for server-side in V2+.

**Status:** Complete as of 04/05/2025.

**Changes from V1.2:** Streamlined column defs (removed duplicates),
clarified persistence examples.

**Data Entry Usage Guide V1.1**  
**Purpose:** Reference for DataEntry module interactions/extensions.
Outlines validation, persistence, copy/paste in 26-column table. Assumes
CoreSetup familiarity; focuses on usage.

**Version History:**

- V1.0 (04/11/2025): Documented completed module.

- V1.1: Cleaned overlaps with CoreSetup, fixed grammar.

**Overview:**

- File: data-entry.js.

- Dependencies: health-log.html, setup.js, styles.css.

- Functionality: Enables entry in Inputs/Lists, updates H from E,
  copy/paste.

**Table Interaction:**

- Structure: 26 columns, Inputs (), List (\<select\>), Outputs
  (.output). Selecting: Click/drag for range (.selected), Ctrl+click for
  rows. Entering: Click to edit; changes auto-save. Input
  Validation/Formatting: A (Date): "mm/dd"; invalid alert; Enter in last
  adds placeholder. D (Time): Inherited from CoreSetup ("HH:MM AM/PM");
  formats on Enter. G/I/V: Numeric only; invalid alert. V: Defaults to
  prior if E set. Event Selection (E): Options: "Diet", "Walk", etc.
  Intensity Popup: For exercises, opens "\[Event\] Intensity" with
  Low/Medium/Heavy buttons; sets "Gym-H", etc. H Update: Based on E
  (e.g., "Diet" → "Carb (g)"). Copy/Paste: Ctrl+C: Copies all 26 columns
  (tab-separated), "Select" for blank E. Notification: "Copied!" (teal,
  2s). Ctrl+V: Pastes to Inputs/Lists only; validates; adds placeholder
  if last row. Data Persistence: Changes save to localStorage
  (healthsync.logs.tableData). Loading: Restores on load, sets E/H.
  Integration Points: Calculations: Access tableData for metrics.
  Charts: Use copy logic for data extraction. Scalability: Handles 3000
  rows in 3 MB cache. Usage Tips: Add data: Start in Inputs/Lists; E
  updates H auto. Copy All: Select full table for Excel export.
  Debugging: Check localStorage, inspect H. Summary: Documents completed
  DataEntry as of 04/11/2025; provides reference for
  entry/validation/persistence. Tailored for future modules. Current
  Status of the Project V1.34 Purpose: Snapshot of progress,
  completed/in-progress features, updates, next steps. Version History:

  medium), etc. New Products: Hypertension/Weight (V2-3, high),
  Asthma/CKD (V3, medium), etc. Revenue: Data sales (V3, low).
  Compliance: FDA/GDPR (V4+, low), HITECH (V2-3, medium-low). Priority
  Order: V1 complete; V2 HIPAA/integrations; V3 data/wearables; V4
  AI/expansion. Roadmap: V1 done; V2 partnerships (~\$15K); V3
  integrations (~\$10K); V4 AI (~\$7.5K). Notes: Strategy (Grok codes
  V1-3, hire V4); lessons (CSS caching, modals, placeholders); evolution
  (client to server). Changes from V1.2: Updated timelines, consolidated
  priorities. Revised: CoreSetup_Arch_V1.0.docx Title: CoreSetup
  Architecture V1.1 Version: 1.1 (Updated July 10, 2025) Purpose:
  Outlines CoreSetup architecture for maintenance/modularity. Simplifies
  edits via file splitting (25-file limit), IndexedDB, event
  hierarchies. Supports future features without rewrites. Architecture
  Overview: Directory: healthsync-root/scripts/core (table-manager.js,
  etc.), styles/core.css, pages/health-log.html. Total 25 files. Module
  Roles: table-manager (rendering), event-handlers (events),
  state-manager (IndexedDB), etc. Setup.js Reduction: Split ~1000 lines
  into ~200-line files; IndexedDB eliminates DOM scraping. Storage
  (IndexedDB): Schema: healthsyncDB; stores: logs (year key, tableData),
  settings (config). Functions: initializeDB(), getState(year),
  saveTableData(year, data). Impact: Async, reliable; pages use
  state-manager. Event Hierarchy: CoreSetup: Table (click →
  cell-selected), Modal (click → log-created), Nav (change →
  state-updated). Other Pages: State-updated for refresh. Listener
  Hierarchy: event-handlers.js: Table click/keydown/input (delegated).
  nav-manager.js: Year/actions change. Centralized for modularity.
  Modularity: 8/10; single-purpose, loose coupling via event-bus.
  Dependency Guide: (Table as in original, capped at 6 files/module.)
  Transition Strategy: Phase 1: Document; 2: Split setup.js; 3: Pages;
  4: Enhance; 5: Maintain. Benefits: Small files, isolated tasks, easy
  edits. Risks: Missing uploads (mitigated by guide). Changes from V1.0:
  Fixed inconsistencies (e.g., align with localStorage if not switched
  to IndexedDB yet), updated dates, streamlined directory. Revised:
  CoreSetup_Recommendation.docx Title: CoreSetup Recommendations V1.1
  Version: 1.1 (Updated July 10, 2025) Analysis of Problem: Event
  Complexity: Scattered listeners cause conflicts (e.g., F/W text
  selection). Script Interplay: Dependencies between
  setup.js/nav.js/styles.css slow edits. Relearning: No central
  reference for flow. Recommended Solutions: Consolidate Listeners:
  Delegate at table level (code examples provided). Modularize Handlers:
  New event-handlers.js (exports handleTableClick, etc.). Simplify
  Interplay: Add state.js for shared state (getState, setCurrentYear).
  Architecture Document: Create CoreSetup_Architecture (outline
  provided, consistent with revised version above). Impact on Coding:
  Rearchitecting would ease changes (e.g., F/W copy-paste via
  delegation). Productivity: 3-4x improvement (less
  relearning/conflicts). Changes from Original: Removed redundancies
  (e.g., repeated examples), updated code to match current
  (localStorage), clarified benefits. Revised: Project HealthSync
  V1.41.docx (If Not Archiving) If retaining: Merge into DE_V1.34 as
  appendix for code examples. Otherwise, archive as advised. Upload
  Limit in Projects No, there is no strict 10-document upload limit in
  Grok conversations (our "Projects" mode). You can upload as many as
  needed per message or across messages—practical limits are per-file
  size (up to 1GB) and total context (up to ~1M tokens, handling large
  codebases). For 26 program files, upload in batches (e.g., 5-10 per
  message) to keep things manageable; I'll analyze them collectively as
  ground truth for line-specific edits/debugging. If media quotas apply
  (e.g., on free plan, ~3/day), code/text files don't count toward that.
  Zip them if preferred for one upload.\</select\>
